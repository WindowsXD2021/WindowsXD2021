### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm WindowsXD. I'm like writing in high-level languages like *Python*, but I have many projects writed in *Java*. Recently I'm tried to learn *NASM Assembly*, but I's very difficult. I'm creating also tutorials, [this](https://gist.github.com/WindowsXD2021/ef85b6f551966d8a9e4667efad028ab2) is tutorial *how to set up xampp*.
